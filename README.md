### Info
A Maven plugin that compiles JSPs into class files, copies these into the final artifact, and updates the web.xml to reference the compiled classes. This is a fork of the [Codehaus jspc-maven-plugin](http://mojo.codehaus.org/jspc/jspc-maven-plugin/) that resolves some long standing issues and gets the Tomcat 7 support released.

### Usage
See the [Maven Project Documentation](http://developer.jasig.org/projects/jspc-maven-plugin/2.0.0/jspc-maven-plugin/plugin-info.html) for goal documentation.

[Plugin Usage](http://developer.jasig.org/projects/jspc-maven-plugin/2.0.0/jspc-maven-plugin/usage.html) is also documented on the maven site.

### JSP Compilers
The available JSP compilers can be found by browsing [org.jasig.mojo.jspc GroupId](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.jasig.mojo.jspc%22).
